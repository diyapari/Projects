1.Breast Cancer Prediction Project:

• I aimed to accurately predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant.

• Utilized a machine learning approach, training a model using the AIML programming language.

• Collected a dataset from kaggle with information on tumor characteristics like size, shape, and texture in tabular format.

• Preprocessed the data and employed machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, K-NN, XgBoost.

• Assessed model performance using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

• Outcome: Developed a model that accurately predicts tumor malignancy, valuable for medical diagnosis.I have achieved a accuracy 98.24% by XgBoost model.

2. Emotion Detection Project:

• Analyzed facial expressions to predict the expressed emotion using convolutional neural networks (CNN).     

• Utilized a large dataset of labeled facial expressions representing emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, etc.

• Implemented deep learning techniques in Python with libraries like Keras and TensorFlow.

• Tested the model on unseen images to evaluate performance.

• Outcome: Created a model that accurately identifies emotions in facial expressions, useful for sentiment analysis.

3. Movie Recommendation Project:

• Developed a recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques.

• Collected user preferences and behaviors to suggest relevant movies.

• Implemented the project using Jupyter Notebook and Python, with libraries like pandas and scikit-learn.

• Utilized collaborative filtering algorithms like user-based and item-based filtering.

• Incorporated matrix factorization techniques to improve recommendation accuracy.

• Outcome: Created a system that offers personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences, enhancing movie-watching experiences.
